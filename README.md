## 🧠 Problem Statement

LinkedIn serves as a powerful platform for professional networking and brand engagement. However, accurately forecasting engagement on posts remains a challenge. This project aims to:
- Predict the number of reactions using post and company features.
- Compare multiple regression models.
- Provide actionable insights for improving LinkedIn content strategy.

### 🔢 Numerical Features:
- `Followers`: Number of company followers.
- `Connections`: Number of direct LinkedIn connections.
- `Comments`: Number of comments received.
- `Num Hashtags`: Hashtags used in the post.
- `Hashtag Followers`: Followers of used hashtags.
- `Views`: Number of post views.
- `Votes`: Votes received (for poll-type posts).

### 🔤 Categorical Features:
- `Name`, `Headline`, `Location`, `About`
- `Content`, `Content Links`, `Time Spent`
- `Media Type`: [`Video`, `Image`, `Article`, `Poll`]
- `Hashtags`, `Media URLs`

### 🎯 Target Variable:
- `Reactions`: Total reactions (like, celebrate, support, insightful, curious, etc.)
